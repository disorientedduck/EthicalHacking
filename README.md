# Basic Tasks (Week 1) – Foundations of Ethical Hacking
Environment Setup
Install Kali Linux (VMWare, VirtualBox, or Dual Boot).
Learn basic Linux commands and terminal usage.
Set up a secure lab environment using Kali + Metasploitable2 in VirtualBox.
Networking Basics
Understand IP, MAC, DNS, DHCP, TCP/IP protocols.
Learn about ports, services, and packet structure (use Wireshark).
Run basic tools: ifconfig, ping, netstat, traceroute, nmap.
Footprinting and Reconnaissance
Learn passive vs active reconnaissance.
Use tools: whois, nslookup, theHarvester, Shodan.io.
Discover open ports with Nmap.
Hands-On Task
Perform a basic Nmap scan on your local network.
Use Wireshark to capture and analyze packets.

# Intermediate Tasks (Week 2) – Scanning, Enumeration, and Vulnerabilities
Scanning & Enumeration
Perform advanced Nmap scans (version detection, OS detection, scripts).
Use Nikto, Dirb, and Gobuster for web directory and vulnerability scanning.
System Hacking Basics
Learn about password cracking: John the Ripper, Hydra.
Understand password storage (hashes) and cracking with wordlists (rockyou.txt).
Practice on Metasploitable2 with msfconsole.
Vulnerability Analysis
Use Searchsploit to find exploits in Exploit-DB.
Scan systems using OpenVAS or Nessus (if licensed).
Learn about CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
Hands-On Task
Crack a password-protected ZIP or PDF file using dictionary attack.
Perform enumeration on a vulnerable Linux system.

# Advanced Tasks (Week 3 and 4) – Exploitation and Privilege Escalation
Exploitation Frameworks
Use Metasploit for exploiting known vulnerabilities.
Exploit Windows and Linux machines using payloads.
Privilege Escalation
Learn Linux privilege escalation (SUID, cronjobs, environment variables).
Practice Windows escalation (unquoted paths, services, tokens).
Web Application Hacking
Understand OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, etc.).
Use Burp Suite for intercepting and modifying requests.
Perform SQL Injection manually and with sqlmap.
Hands-On Tasks
Exploit a vulnerable VM from VulnHub (e.g., Mr. Robot or Basic Pentesting).
Gain root/admin access using privilege escalation techniques.
