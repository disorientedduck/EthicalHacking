1. Environment Setup

Tasks Completed:

Kali Linux Installation:

  * Successfully installed Kali Linux using VirtualBox on a Windows host machine.
  * Allocated 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, and 40GB virtual storage for optimal performance.
  * Verified the installation by updating system repositories and installing key packages.

Basic Linux Command Line Usage:

    * ls, cd, mkdir, rm, touch, cat, cp, mv
    * apt update && apt upgrade for system maintenance
    * Navigated file system structure and permissions (chmod, chown, ls -l)

Secure Lab Setup with Metasploitable2:

  * Installed Metasploitable2 on VirtualBox alongside Kali Linux.
  * Set both VMs to use Host-Only Adapter to isolate them from external networks while allowing inter-VM communication.
  * Verified connectivity using ping and ifconfig from within both machines.



2. Networking Basics

Key Concepts Studied:

Understanding Protocols and Services:

    * IP Addresses (IPv4), MAC Addresses, DNS, DHCP, and TCP/IP stack.
    * Port ranges (0-1023 = well-known ports) and common service ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP).

Tools and Their Usage:

  * ifconfig / ip a – to view and configure network interfaces.
  * ping – to test network connectivity.
  * netstat – to view open connections and listening ports.
  * traceroute – to map network paths.
  * nmap – to scan hosts and discover open ports/services.

Packet Analysis:

  * Installed and used **Wireshark** to capture network traffic.
  * Identified basic packet structures including headers (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP).
  * Tracked a DNS query from initiation to response to understand the resolution process.


3. Footprinting and Reconnaissance

Passive Reconnaissance:

  Used tools like:

    * whois – to gather domain registration data.
    * nslookup – to fetch DNS records.
    * theHarvester – to scrape emails, hosts, and open source data.
    * Shodan.io – to explore exposed internet-connected devices.

Active Reconnaissance:

  * Performed targeted **Nmap scans** on Metasploitable2 to discover:

    * Open ports (e.g., 21, 22, 23, 80)
    * Services running on those ports
    * Possible OS fingerprinting

4. Hands-On Tasks

Nmap Scan:

  * Conducted a basic scan using:
    nmap -sS 192.168.56.102
    * Discovered multiple open ports and services on the Metasploitable2 target.

Wireshark Packet Capture:

  * Captured traffic between Kali and Metasploitable2 while performing Nmap scan.
  * Analyzed packet flow, including:

    * TCP SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK flags
    * ICMP echo requests
    * Service banners during connection attempts

Conclusion:

The lab setup and exercises provided foundational hands-on experience in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I have successfully built a safe and functional testing environment using VirtualBox, Kali Linux, and Metasploitable2. Through practical use of essential networking tools and reconnaissance techniques, I have developed a better understanding of how attackers might map a network—knowledge crucial for defending it.
